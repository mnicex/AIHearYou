# AIHearYou
AI Hear You - repo for the 2025 MS Hackathon

This project aims to develop a prototype of an AI-enhanced hearing aid device designed to support elderly individuals and people 
with specific types of hearing loss. By integrating Azure AI services, Python (TBD), and embedded systems, the solution will go beyond 
traditional amplification to offer intelligent, adaptive hearing support. The device will leverage AI to:

Filter background noise and enhance speech clarity. 
Recognize voices and prioritize familiar or important speakers. 
Translate speech in real-time to assist in multilingual environments. 
Adapt to changing sound environments (e.g., quiet room vs. busy street). Detect emotions in speech to provide contextual awareness. 
Transcribe conversations and generate actionable notifications or reminders.

The initial proof-of-concept will use a standard Bluetooth audio device paired with a mobile phone, 
simulating the core features. 

The long-term vision includes a standalone hearing aid device with embedded AI capabilities. 

Goals:

Prototype Development: Build a working demo that showcases key AI features using Azure Cognitive Services and Python. 

Accessibility Impact: 

Improve quality of life for users by enhancing communication and situational awareness. 

Scalability Exploration: 

Investigate pathways to integrate the solution into standalone hardware.

User-Centric Design: 

Ensure the interface and experience are intuitive, especially for elderly users. 

Hackathon Readiness: 

Deliver a compelling demo and presentation that highlights innovation, feasibility, and social impact.
